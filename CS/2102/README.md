# CS 2102 - OBJECT-ORIENTED DESIGN CONCEPTS
### Prof. Glynis Hamel

This course introduces students to an object-oriented model of programming. Building from the design methodology covered in CS 1101/CS 1102, this course shows how programs can be decomposed into classes and objects. By emphasizing design, this course shows how to implement small defect-free programs and evaluate design decisions to select an optimal design under specific assumptions. Topics include inheritance, exceptions, interface, design by contract, basic design patterns, and reuse. Students will be expected to design, implement, and debug object-oriented programs composed of multiple classes and over a variety of data structures. Recommended background: CS 1101 or CS 1102.
