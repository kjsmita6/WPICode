WPIâ€™s Computer Science department is as diverse and varied as the field of computer science itself, offering courses and specializations in areas such as human-robotic interaction, intelligent tutoring and educational data mining, bioinformatics, computer security and privacy, and graphics and animation, among many others. WPI stays at the forefront of this ever-growing industry so that as society's use of computers expands, our students are confident in their knowledge of developing technologies in the real world through their work on large-scale team projects that make a real difference to the community.

Our hands-on education ensures that graduates of the Computer Science program leave WPI as problem-solvers and accomplished researchers who are ready to hit the ground running and make immediate contributions to this exciting and dynamic field.
