You *must* use the Beginning Student Language for this assignment

For all assignments in this course, you must create your functions according to the HtDF template.  
Therefore, you are expected to provide a signature, a purpose, a stub, test cases and to follow 
commenting guidelines.  Template functions are only required for questions 5 and 6.

Your code should also pass the check-expects shown for each question.  The check-expects are
meant to more formally document the expected functionality and are *not* complete.  You must
come up with at least one additional (interesting) test case for each function.  For a reminder
of why more than one test is needed, see https://xkcd.com/221/

What to hand in:  a .rkt file with your code.  

Hints:
0.  Quickly create stubs so that check-expects run properly and you can execute the starter file.

1.  The first 3 questions are designed to be relatively easy warmup questions.  If you are 
struggling with those you may want to drop back to 1101.  Note:  the questions are designed
to get you dive into the Racket documentation -- you are *not* expected to know the exact 
function to use upon reading the question.  

2.  The last two questions are more challenging, and will require you to have an understanding
of lists, templates, and the idea of self reference

3.  For the first 4 questions, work on test cases first, and try to generate the result
programmatically.  Then worry about how to code it.

4.  For the last 2 questions, start with the function template and think about how to
fill in the "..." areas.  After completing them, you should have a better sense of why we are
following this approach to designing functions.
