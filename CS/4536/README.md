# CS 4536 - PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES
### Prof. Lorenzo De Carli

This course covers the design and implementation of programming languages. Topics include data structures for representing programming languages, implementing control structures (such as functions, recursion, and exceptions), garbage collection, and type systems. Students will be expected to implement several small languages using a functional programming language. Recommended background: CS 2303, CS 3133, and experience programming in a functional language (as provided by CS 1101 or CS 1102). Undergraduate credit may not be earned for both this course and CS 536. This course will be offered in 2016-17, and in alternating years thereafter.
