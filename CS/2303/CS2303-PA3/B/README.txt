structest -- Kyle Smith (kjsmith@wpi.edu)

This program adds an Employee struct that has many functions, including a function to create a random employee, create n amount of
random employees, copy an array of employees to another array, and more.

To run from the command line:
$ make
$ ./structest

From eclipse:
Press the play button

This will automatically run all the functions and tests so you can see what each function does and the values of the variables and pointers
before and after the function runs.
