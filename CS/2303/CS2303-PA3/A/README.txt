PA3A_kjsmith - Kyle Smith (kjsmith@wpi.edu)

This program shows how to rewrite many of the built-in string functions,
including strdup, strcpy, strcat, and more. 

Instructions to compile/run from command line:
$ make
$ ./ctest

Instructions to compile/run from Eclipse:
1. Press play button on the top toolbar

This will run all of the built in test cases which allow you to see what is
happening internally with the pointers and strings, both before and after 
the new version of the mentioned string function is run.
