# Description
This is a repository for all the code I have ever written as part of my coursework for WPI. This includes all CS and ECE courses. Some CS or ECE courses may not have any code associated with them, such as CS 3133 or ECE 4801.

# Missing Work
Some courses that I have taken may have code that is not readily available. At a certain point I began storing all code on GitHub, but before that it was not in a central location so finding it may be hard. Classes I am missing code for:
### Computer Science
[ ] CS 1102 - ACCELERATED INTRODUCTION TO PROGRAM DESIGN
[ ] CS 2102 - OBJECT-ORIENTED DESIGN CONCEPTS
[ ] CS 2223 - ALGORITHMS

### ECE
[ ] ECE 2029 - INTRODUCTION TO DIGITAL CIRCUIT DESIGN
