WPI's Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) Department, located in the historical Atwater Kent Laboratories, is a community of world-class faculty and students conducting research on diverse subjects including machine learning, cryptography and information security, signal processing, autonomous vehicles, smart health, prosthetic control, analog and digital microelectronics, and wireless information networks. We have a strong tradition of making significant contributions to science and engineering, ranging from the invention of the negative feedback amplifier to laying the foundations of the first wireless local area networks.

Through our innovative Theory and Practice curriculum, hands-on laboratories, and project-based learning, the ECE Department continuously strives to develop the next generation of engineers who will develop new technologies and seek creative solutions to societyâ€™s most pressing problems. We pride ourselves on our culture of creative scholarship; faculty, students, and staff work closely together and encourage each other through challenges both in the classroom and in life.
